# Buck-Converter-PINN

### `buck_converter_PINN_avg_model.ipynb` 
  * This file contains a physics-based PINN that converges on the parameters given.
  * Does not generalize well to unseen parameters
---
### `BC_PINN_varyingLoad.ipynb` 
  * This file contains a data-driven network, trained on a varying load that works very well!
